# Rock-Paper-Scissors
First Js Project from scratch.


Lessons learned:

1. Gotta get better and more familliar with arrays and string methods like Math.floor, Math.random, length ,substring, slice, indexOf,charAt etc.

2. There is most probably a better way of writing those if statements, maybe by using a switch but i cant be bothered to do it right now :P

3. I have to follow my own logic and solve the problem the way I wanna solve it unless specifically told to do otherwise. Trying to follow the logic of TOP confused me because in my head I had way of solving this problem.

4. To ignore case sensitivity, one way to do it is to convert both the user input and expected result to lower or uppercase.

5. Be wary of typo mistakes like forgeting parentheses in a function. Always keep in mind when debugging.

6. Gotta understand function parameters and when to return values better.
