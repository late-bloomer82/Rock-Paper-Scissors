# Rock-Paper-Scissors
First Js Project from scratch.


Lessons learned:

1. Gotta get better and more familliar with arrays and string methods like Math.floor, Math.random, length ,substring, slice, indexOf,charAt etc.
2. There is most probably a better way of writing those if statements, maybe by using a switch but i cant be bothered to do it right now :P
